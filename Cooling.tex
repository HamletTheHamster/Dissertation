\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Cooling:Introduction}

Materials above the ground state experience therodynamic variations such as temperature and density. These thermal fluctuations alter the optical properties of a given material, allowing a scattering process to occur (see Section \ref{sec:Introduction:Light-Scattering}). Spontaneous Brillouin scattering is the inelastic scattering of light with these thermal fluctuations within a material, facilitating an energy exchange between the optical and acoustic domains. While a given medium typically supports a multitude of thermally excited acoustic modes (including both transverse and longitudinal modes) we focus here specifically on longitudinally travelling acoustic waves to demonstrate cooling in a continuous (non-resonant) system.

\section{Optomechanical Cooling and Heating}
\label{sec:Cooling:Cooling-Heating}

Backward Brillouin scattering targets longitudinally traveling acoustic waves (or phonons) through two complementary processes---Stokes and anti-Stokes, illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:Cooling:StokesHeating} and \ref{fig:Cooling:anti-StokesCooling}, respectively. In the Stokes process, an incident photon of frequency \(\omega\) scatters with a \textit{retreating} phonon of frequency \(\Omega\) annihilating the \textit{photon} and creating both an additional phonon of frequency \(\Omega\) and a backscattered photon at the difference energy (\(\omega_{\mathrm{Stokes}} = \omega - \Omega\)). In this way, both energy and momentum are conserved. This can be visualized by an analogy, in which the incident light experiences a doppler \textit{down}-shift in frequeny as though the photon were reflected from a retreating mirror. Since this processes results in an increase in the phonon population within the respective longitudinal mode of the material, this process is referred to as optomechanical heating. The energy lost by the light is gained by the material in the form of mechanical vibrations.

    \caption{Illustration of optomechanical heating and cooling processes. Figure \ref{fig:Cooling:StokesHeating} shows an incident photon of frequency \(\omega\) scattering with a retreating phonon of frequency \(\Omega\), resulting in the annihilation of the incident photon and the creation of both an additional retreating phonon of frequency \(\Omega\) and a backwards propagating photon of reduced frequency and thereby energy (\(\omega_{\mathrm{Stokes}} = \omega - \Omega\)). Figure \ref{fig:Cooling:anti-StokesCooling} shows the inverse process, whereby an incident photon, \(\omega\), scatters with an approaching phonon, \(\Omega\), annihilating the incident photon and the phonon to produce a backwards propagating photon of increased frequency and thereby energy (\(\omega_{\mathrm{anti-Stokes}} = \omega + \Omega\)).}
    \label{fig:Cooling:StokesProcesses}
\end{figure}

The anti-Stokes process is the inverse process, whereby an \textit{approaching} phonon of frequency \(\Omega\) scatters with an incident photon of frequency \(\omega\), annihilating the \textit{phonon} and creating a backscattered photon at the addition energy (\(\omega_{\mathrm{anti-Stokes}} = \omega + \Omega\)). Both energy and momentum are again conserved, however in the anti-Stokes process, the incident light experiences a doppler \textit{up}-shift in frequency as if, to continue the analogy, the photon were reflected from an approaching mirror. For further intuition, one might consider an elastic collision of a ball (the photon) with a moving wall (the phonon) for the cases of the wall moving towards (in the anti-Stokes process) or away (in the Stokes process) from the ball as they collide. This simple analogy helps illustrate how momentum and energy are exchanged in optomechanical heating (Stokes) and cooling (anti-Stokes) processes.

While spontaneous Brillouin scattering processes naturally alter phonon populations (and thus mode temperatures), practical demonstration and detection of these effects pose significant challenges. Foremost among these is the requirement to remain in the spontaneous regime: we wish to probe the natural thermal phonons in a medium, so we cannot rely on artificially driving the mechanical modes to enhance scattered power (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:comparison}, and specifically Figure~\ref{fig:SponBSvsStimBSvsCoBS}, for a comparison of scattered power produced by different Brillouin techniques). Although stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is often employed to boost signal levels, it actively drives phonon populations via injected optical fields, and thus no longer measures the intrinsic thermal phonons. In practical terms, SBS occurs when the overall process gain factor \(G = G_{B}P_{P}L\) (where \(G_{B}\) is the effective Brillouin gain, \(P_{P}\) the pump power, and \(L\) the effective length) far exceeds unity (\(G \gg 1\)).

To demonstrate optomechanical cooling (i.e., an anti-Stokes process that lowers phonon energy), one must detect scattered light from a mode whose phonon population has been reduced. This is intrinsically difficult because a decreased phonon population means fewer scattering events, and hence diminished backscattered light. Consequently, an ideal testbed should provide sufficiently high single-pass gain (overall gain factor near unity) to enable clear detection, yet remain below the threshold that would drive the process into the stimulated regime. Achieving this balance ensures that measurements reflect genuine spontaneous cooling of a thermally populated phonon mode, rather than an artifact of optically driven phonons.

In addition to the requirement that the overall process gain be near but below unity, temporal constraints impose further critical conditions. Specifically, the rate at which phonons are removed from the system must exceed the rate at which they are replenished by the thermal bath to ensure net cooling of the anti-Stokes mode. This condition demands that backscattered photons leave the system rapidly, carrying away the extracted mechanical energy. A mean-field analysis (see Appendix~A of \cite{johnson2023laser}) shows that the relevant depletion rate is \(4v_{g}/L\), where \(v_{g}\) is the group velocity of the anti-Stokes light and \(L\) is the system length. This must exceed the mechanical dissipation rate \(\Gamma_{0}\), which represents the natural return of the phonon mode to thermal equilibrium. Hence, a suitable platform for demonstrating optomechanical cooling of traveling-wave phonons must fulfill the fast escape condition \(4v_{g}/L > \Gamma_{0}\). Meeting this requirement on system length, however, directly conflicts with the desire for a sufficiently high overall gain factor, illustrating the delicate balance needed for effective cooling.

% Ideal testbed for demonstrating optomechanical cooling:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Large acousto-optic coupling
% \item Tight confinement of light and sound
% \item Sound speed not too fast (too large brillouin frequency shift, expensive fast elecronics for detection) or too slow (too small brillouin frequency shift, making it hard to separate sideband from carrier)
% \item Large single pass gain GPL
% \item Fast escape condition - phonon mode depletion rate must exceed repopulation rate \(4v_{g}/L > \Gamma\)
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Cooling Platform: \texorpdfstring{$CS_{2}$}{CS2}-\acl{LCOF}}
\label{sec:Cooling:Platform}

To demonstrate optomechanical cooling of traveling wave phonons, we utilize \SI{1}{\meter} of \acl{LCOF} filled with carbon disulfide, similar to that used by Behunin et al. (2019). \cite{behunin2019spontaneous} This platform features large optomechanical coupling due to the high electrostritive response of \ce{CS2}, enabling sufficient scattering for the relatively short length required to satisfy the fast-escape condition (\(4v_{g}/L \approx\) \SI{0.82}{\giga\hertz} and \(\Gamma_{0} \approx\) \SI{0.61}{\giga\hertz}). In addition to

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Cooling:Discussion}

Ideas to achieve net cooling, one might design a system where:

1) single pass gain bias
     swing energy transfer bias to favor anti-Stokes over Stokes (mode-dependent gain)
     the Stokes process were not permitted (ryan's only idea), or just significantly restricted - what is that bias threshold requirement?
     currently, we are net *heating* the system because it is easier to heat from equilibrium than cool (right? explore this. it's also hard to make it hotter beyond a certain point.)
     implementation ideas:
       multi-pump scheme to destructively interfere with Stokes and/or constructively interfere with anti-Stokes
       doping or specialized waveguide gratings that pick out the Stokes band for out-of-plane scattering

2) time bias
     create an energy transfer *rate* bias between Stokes and anti-Stokes
     can be accomplished with either the brillouin energy transfer rate or the repopulation rate

       brillouin process rate:
         4vg/L, have either group velocity or length be different for Stokes vs anti-Stokes (smaller vg or larger L for Stokes than anti-Stokes)
         make anti-Stokes fast light and/or Stokes slow light
         vg inversely proportional to pump power, so it's a balance
           increasing pump power = slower escape time (4vgL), and also larger dissipation (Gamma+)

       repopulation rate:
         thermally insulate the anti-Stokes mode from the thermal bath that would repopulate it
         or at least insulate it some amount more than Stokes (what is that threshold? even if it's only net cooled for picoseconds, what is that minimum crossover point insulation bias point)
         essentially locks in the cooled mode while letting the heated mode spill out
         implementation idea:
           design a fiber/waveguide with acoustic directional bias, such that phonons travelling one direction dissipate quicker because of the geometry/acoustic properties of the fiber. (triangles? acting as tapered acoustic dissipators, pointing in one direction?)

3) starting temperature
     Could you acieve net cooling in a cheap and dirty sense by starting the system in a very heated state, thus invoking a natural dissipation rate bias?! - yes!
     Things do naturally run hot, perhaps no extra fancy engineering is needed for some practical systems? (data processing, reduce thermal noise from above ambient heat)
     not traditional definition of optical refrigeration below ambient/thermal bath, but still *useful*
     is this already done? lit search

Think about a practical device or system for each of these cases (think waveguide playground!)
