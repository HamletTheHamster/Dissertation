Figure \ref {fig:Cooling:StokesHeating} shows an incident photon of frequency \(\omega \) scattering with a retreating phonon of frequency \(\Omega \), resulting in the annihilation of the incident photon and the creation of both an additional retreating phonon of frequency \(\Omega \) and a backwards propagating photon of reduced frequency and thereby energy (\(\omega _{\mathrm {Stokes}} = \omega - \Omega \)). Figure \ref {fig:Cooling:anti-StokesCooling} shows the inverse process, whereby an incident photon, \(\omega \), scatters with an approaching phonon, \(\Omega \), annihilating the incident photon and the phonon to produce a backwards propagating photon of increased frequency and thereby energy (\(\omega _{\mathrm {anti-Stokes}} = \omega + \Omega \)).}}{11}{figure.caption.38}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces Schematic of \ac {LCOF} design. A length of \ac {SMF-28} is arc-spliced to 5-\SI {10}{\centi \meter } of \ac {UHNA7} fiber, with a post-arc process applied to taper the larger \ac {SMF-28} core down to the smaller \ac {UHNA7} core for better mode matching and coupling efficiency. The \ac {UHNA7} fiber is angle-cleaved and fusion-spliced to a flat-cleaved hollow-core fiber via a heated filament in a Vytran fusion splicer system. The angle cleave results in a splice that only partially fuses the two fibers, leaving a pathway for liquid to enter the hollow core fiber via capillary action once submerged. A mirrored splice configuration on the other end of the length of hollow-core fiber allows air to escape as the fiber fills, and a reverse taper again provides improved mode matching for the light to recouple into \ac {SMF-28}.}}{13}{figure.caption.39}%

A \ac {LO} is synthesized from the pump laser for heterodyne detection, whereby a \acl {PC} is used to align the polarization of the \ac {LO} to that of the backscattered signal.

Backscattered Stokes and anti-Stokes components of both the pump and the probe retrace to the first \ac {PBS}, where the respective polarization states of each ensure a re-separation of backscattered pump and probe light.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces Design schematic of a coherently stimulated phonon spectrometer. A tunable \ac {CW} laser at approximately \SI {1.55}{\micro \meter } emits light that passes through an isolator (Iso) and a splitter, diverting 10\% to a \SI {27}{\dBm } \ac {EDFA} followed by a \ac {VOA}. This pump light (\(\omega _P\)) is polarization-controlled to reflect off a \ac {PBS} and is recoupled to fiber via a \ac {FP}, then directed to the sample either by direct fiber coupling or through a pair of \ac {FP}s and lenses (L) for free-space samples. After passing through the sample, the pump light traverses a corrective polarization controller that mitigates fiber twists and bends before reflecting off a second \ac {PBS}, where it is routed to port (c) for power monitoring. To synthesize the Stokes wave, a 90\% split from the original pump is processed through a \ac {IM} and a \ac {FBG}, generating a Stokes sideband downshifted from the pump by \(\Omega \). This frequency shift is swept via a signal generator to capture \(\Omega _B\). A 99/1 splitter provides a tap at port (a) to optimize Stokes synthesis. The Stokes wave (\(\omega _S\)), amplified by a \SI {1}{\watt } \ac {EDFA} and \ac {VOA}-controlled, counter-propagates along the pump path and is monitored at port (b). A second tunable \ac {CW} laser, detuned from the pump, generates the probe wave (\(\omega _{Pr}\)), which is amplified by a \SI {1}{\watt } \ac {EDFA}, attenuated variably, and polarization-controlled to pass through the initial \ac {PBS} where it is incident on the sample. Backscattered signal light (\(\omega _{Sig}\)) transmits back through the \ac {PBS}, while unscattered probe light transmits to a power meter at port (d). A circulator parts the signal from the probe path, with an \ac {FBG} filtering out any unwanted noise or Stokes light. Finally, the signal is heterodyned with an \ac {EDFA}-amplified, \ac {AOM}-shifted \ac {LO} derived from the probe laser and directed to a photodiode for detection. The resulting \ac {RF} signal is mixed with an \ac {AC} \ac {LO} supplied by the signal generator which sweeps synchronously with the Stokes synthesis frequency, and collected by a lock-in amplifier for data processing. }}{36}{figure.caption.71}%
