%TOO SELF INTERESTED! State facts.
%The work presented in this document details my efforts toward achieving a result for which my time and available resources would prove too limited to accomplish in full. It is my great hope that a dear future reader may someday be inspired to take up where I left off and realize the result that I have been chasing for these years. No physical principle disallows the demonstration of this result, only practical challenges stand in its way.

%The physics involved in this research effort primarily lies in the field of optomechanics, however it veers at times into the related domains of nonlinear optics and nanoscience. I have in fact developed a great love for each of these fields and it was my romantic goal to unite them that originally led me to pursue this work. In this introductory chapter I present the foundational topics and concepts that I employ in later chapters.

Optomechanics is the study of light-matter interactions; it is the study of how the intangible (light) can affect change in the tangible (matter) and visa-versa.
