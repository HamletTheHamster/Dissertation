Orthogonally polarized pump and fixed-power probe light are combined and sent into the sample using a \ac {PBS}. Backscattered pump and probe light exit distinct ports of the PBS, and anti-Stokes sideband is isolated using a circulator and tunable \ac {BPF}. Orthogonally polarized pump and probe beams (b) and (c) couple to the same band of phonons. The scattered probe can be isolated from the scattered pump using a PBS. (d) Backscattered anti-Stokes power spectra for the probe plotted for various pump powers. For clarity the data is averaged over 1.67 MHz bins.
