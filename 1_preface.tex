% This dissertation consists of five chapters: Introduction (\autoref{chap:intro}), three manuscript chapters (\autoref{chap:spweather}, \autoref{chap:roughness}, \autoref{chap:moonpies}), and the Discussion \& Conclusion (\autoref{chap:discussion}). Chapters \ref{chap:spweather}--\ref{chap:moonpies} were prepared as manuscripts to appear in peer-reviewed scientific journals. As of this writing, \textit{\nameref{chap:spweather}} was published as \cite{taiudovicic2021} in Geophysical Research Letters (doi: \url{https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL092198}), chapter \textit{\nameref{chap:moonpies}} was recently submitted to a journal for peer review, and chapter \textit{\nameref{chap:roughness}} is being prepared for submission. During the review process, the contents of Manuscript II and III may change such that their published versions differ from the contents of \autoref{chap:roughness} and \autoref{chap:moonpies}, respectively. Additionally, there may be some redundancy in the contents of the three manuscript chapters which were written to appear as standalone works in the literature.
