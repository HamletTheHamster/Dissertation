A second tunable \ac {CW} laser, detuned from the pump, generates the probe wave (\(\omega _{Pr}\)), which is amplified by a \SI {1}{\watt } \ac {EDFA}, attenuated variably, and polarization-controlled to pass through the initial \ac {PBS} where it is incident on the sample. Backscattered signal light (\(\omega _{Sig}\)) transmits back through the \ac {PBS}, while unscattered probe light transmits to a power meter at port (d). A circulator parts the signal from the probe path, with an \ac {FBG} filtering out any unwanted noise or Stokes light. Finally, the signal is heterodyned with an \ac {EDFA}-amplified, \ac {AOM}-shifted \ac {LO} derived from the probe laser and directed to a photodiode for detection. The resulting \ac {RF} signal is mixed with an \ac {AC} \ac {LO} supplied by the signal generator which sweeps synchronously with the Stokes synthesis frequency, and collected by a lock-in amplifier for data processing}{section*.79}{}}

A tunable \ac {CW} laser at approximately \SI {1.55}{\micro \meter } emits light that passes through an isolator (Iso) and a splitter, diverting 10\% to a \SI {27}{\dBm } \ac {EDFA} followed by a \ac {VOA}. This pump light (\(\omega _P\)) is polarization-controlled to reflect off a \ac {PBS} and is recoupled to fiber via a \ac {FP}, then directed to the sample either by direct fiber coupling or through a pair of \ac {FP}s and lenses (L) for free-space samples. After passing through the sample, the pump light traverses a corrective polarization controller that mitigates fiber twists and bends before reflecting off a second \ac {PBS}, where it is routed to port (c) for power monitoring. To synthesize the Stokes wave, a 90\% split from the original pump is processed through a \ac {IM} and a \ac {FBG}, generating a Stokes sideband downshifted from the pump by \(\Omega \). This frequency shift is swept via a signal generator to capture \(\Omega _B\). A 99/1 splitter provides a tap at port (a) to optimize Stokes synthesis. The Stokes wave (\(\omega _S\)), amplified by a \SI {1}{\watt } \ac {EDFA} and \ac {VOA}-controlled, counter-propagates along the pump path and is monitored at port (b).
