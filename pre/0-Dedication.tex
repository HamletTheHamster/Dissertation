\textit{Dr. Gibbs, John, friend,}
\vspace{1em}

\textit{I owe so much to you. You saw a scientist in me even after the world concluded otherwise. You taught me self worth and friendship, and you showed me that the best work is accomplished when everyone is having fun. Scientists are human, and science is better for this fact.}% You will always be my advisor. Nobody can ever take any of this away from you. Fuck what the world thinks.}

\textit{Live long and prosper, my friend.}
