\textit{Dr. Gibbs, John, friend,}

\textit{I owe so much to you. You saw a scientist in me even after the world thought otherwise. You taught me self worth and friendship, and you showed me that the best work is accomplished when everyone is having fun. Scientists are human, and science is better for this fact.}

\textit{Live long and prosper, my friend.}
