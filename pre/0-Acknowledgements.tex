A PhD is a nonlinear process whereby a Mr. particle is annihilated to create a Dr. particle at the difference energy of everything it took.

To my parents, who have steadfastly supported my education and interests for the entirety of my life. To Lauren, the love of my life, who lifted me back up in my lowest moments; let's never simultaneously get PhDs again! To my advisors and committee members, whose mentorship I needed much more than most. To Dr. Gary Bowman, who traversed a journey through roles in my life from professor to landlord to personal mentor and friend. To my lab mates, who understand the extent to which nano and Watt should be considered four letter words. To the Physics department at NAU, who took me under their wing and nurtured my love of teaching. To my friends and family, past and present, near and far, who all show me tremendous love and support. And finally to Hiro and Pasta, my two little guinnea pig roommates, who seem to have it all figured out.

\textit{Thank you}.
